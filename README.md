## Dark/Light Mode
 Create a clickable button using js to switch a webpage between dark and light modes.
 - Set up file structure, index.html, assets/js, assets/css.
 - Thinking of trying to make the old gallery page the index for this assignment.
 - Apparently css wont accept let and const as keywords? Need to use var?
 - Have used const in the JS portion and var in css and things seem to be working okay. Ask Tony about this.
 - Switch is working so far on a basic page with nothing on it. Want to change the button to something nicer looking.
 - Wondering if theme change will swap colors on SVG elements as well... Will add logo to see.
